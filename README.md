## How To Use

### Prerequisites
To start developing this application, you first need the following software installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with npm)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [PHP >= 8.0](https://www.apachefriends.org/it/download.html)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Setup
1. Clone the project from Github
2. In the project folder run `npm install`
3. In the project folder run `composer update`

### Run the application
Since we moved to Tailwind CSS, to run the application you should do:
1. `docker-compose up`
2. On another shell, `npm run dev` (for Tailwind CSS realtime changes)

We recommend to use PHPStorm as developing IDE, in this case in the folder `.run` are already present automatic run configurations. Select `Start` configuration and click on the run icon.
